## Welcome to my second repository, named Paw_Palace. This project serves different objectives from the previous project (Historia- History app).

### Objective(s):
1. In project 2 or assignment 2 the objective is to make a "Tamagotshi" app based on the popular 1990s virtual pet toy, named "Tamagotshi". This app should mimick the original toy's experience.
2. The user must be able to take care of their virtual pet by performing tasks such as:
* feeding the pet
* playing with the pet
* bathing the pet
* taking the pet to sleep.
* analysing the health status of the pet to assess their needs.

  3. My personal objective for the app includes ensuring that users have an intimate feel while playing the game and to achieve this objective, I have added a small welcome message at the beginning of the application to make users feel welcomed. Furthermore, each screen from the app serves to represent the name of the activity or screen symbolising the current environment of the suppossed activity between users and their beloved pet. Alongside the name of activity, I bare witty slogans meant to make the user feel the sensation of coziness while on the app.
 
  5. # Below examples of the activity with their slogans are displayed:
    * The Eatery -( displays on the screen when users click the Eat button) - 
    * The games room -(displays on the screen when user clicks the play button) - "Pups just wanna have fun"
    * Sleep - ( displays on the screen when user clicks on the sleep button) - "Let Sleeping dogs lie."
 
      ## Design considerations :
  Considering the fact that I am a beginner in Mobile Application, I've made a simple design of the app so that user's action prompts are matched with a matching image displaying their actions.
  The screen should not only display the image but must also show user the status update when the pet performs the action based on the user's input prompt. For example, when the user clicks on begin it should direct users to second activity which is called the eatery, upon arriving we should be confronted by the the "hunger" status of the pet to be at 10 or above signalling the pet being hungry. Once the user presses the feed button the "hunger" status should decrease to 0. 

  
   # Objective considerations -
  there must be data retrieval from the user clicking actions like fed, to do this I will attempt to add a textview and with this textview I will add the stats on the screen to display status levels as default before a user attends to them. For example - The pet's default hunger level will be 10, once the user selects "Feed" users must remain in "the eatery activity" but must also have the statistics awaiting them. In turn once the pet has been fed the stat "hunger" should decrease to a 0 showing that the pet has been fed.

   ## My experience during the process of doing Assignment 2:
Learning from past mistakes is an important part of growth in any field, including application development.I may have faced challenges understanding button functions or objectives in my first mission. However, by revisiting these concepts, experimenting in Paw Palace and applying my knowledge, I have gained a deeper understanding and improved my skills.

Also, as I mentioned to have a more complex design idea, it's important to consider the overall user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) of my app. Placement of buttons, colors, text and features affect how users use and perceive my app. Continuously honing my design skills and incorporating user feedback can lead to an improved and more engaging app.

All in all, my journey in Paw Palace is one of growing and learning when implementing button actions with intents and the startActivity(intent) method. This is a step towards creating a more functional, user-friendly and aesthetic application. I shall continue to explore new concepts, experiment and hone my skills to improve my application development skills.

# Utilising Github and Github actions:
After finishing the design and coding process of the app, I then had to push the code(with its files to Github). This is how I pushed the code:
# Creating a repository for your app on Github:
1. First create the repository (this is if you do not have a repository for your app yet)
2. Choose whether you would like the repository to be private or public(visibility)
3. Add a README file (optional,but preferable)
4. then click "create repository" (this finilises the creation of the repository).

# Uploading or PUSHING the project from Android Studio to Github: 
1. go to VCS (version control system) on Android Studio
2. Enable version control integration
3. A checkbox/ dropdown should appear, please ensure that Git is selected.
4. click "ok"
5. All files on android studio should turn red
6. Go to the farleft of your screen on android studio, change "android" to "project".
7. Right-click on the first folder you see.
8. you should see options of your right after right-clicking the folder, select "Git"
9. then "add" (this adds all files to version control system)
10. Repeat step 6 and click "Git" again then select "commit directory".
11. On the screen you should see a message saying "commit message"
12. Simply type "Initial Commit" then select the "commit" button.
13. "Find Git on the topmost of your android studio, then select "push"
14. Define remote by copying and pasting the link to your repository on "define remote"
15. You will then be asked to login to Github or use a token, the choice is yours. (personally, I logged in)
16. After logging in, select "push"
