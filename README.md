# Welcome
## Welcome to my second repository, named Paw_Palace. This project serves different objectives from the previous project (Historia- History app).

### Objective(s):
1. In project 2 or assignment 2 the objective is to make a "Tamagotshi" app based on the popular 1990s virtual pet toy, named "Tamagotshi". This app should mimick the original toy's experience.
2. The user must be able to take care of their virtual pet by performing tasks such as:
* feeding the pet
* playing with the pet
* bathing the pet
* taking the pet to sleep.
* analysing the health status of the pet to assess their needs.

  3. My personal objective for the app includes ensuring that users have an intimate feel while playing the game and to achieve this objective, I have added a small welcome message at the beginning of the application to make users feel welcomed. Furthermore, each screen from the app serves to represent the name of the activity or screen symbolising the current environment of the suppossed activity between users and their beloved pet. Alongside the name of activity, I bare witty slogans meant to make the user feel the sensation of coziness while on the app.
  4. # Below examples of the activity with their slogans are displayed:
    * The Eatery -( displays on the screen when users click the Eat button) - 
    * The games room -(displays on the screen when user clicks the play button) - "Pups just wanna have fun"
    * Sleep - ( displays on the screen when user clicks on the sleep button) - "Let Sleeping dogs lie."
 
      ## Design considerations :
  Considering the fact that I am a beginner in Mobile Application, I've made a simple design of the app so that user's action prompts are matched with a matching image displaying their actions.
  The screen should not only display the image but must also show user the status update when the pet performs the action based on the user's input prompt. For example, when the user clicks on begin it should direct users to second activity which is called the eatery, upon arriving we should be confronted by the the "hunger" status of the pet to be at 10 or above signalling the pet being hungry. Once the user presses the feed button the "hunger" status should decrease to 0. 

  
   # Objective considerations -
  there must be data retrieval from the user clicking actions like fed, to do this I will attempt to add a textview and with this textview I will add the stats on the screen to display status levels as default before a user attends to them. For example - The pet's default hunger level will be 10, once the user selects "Feed" users must remain in "the eatery activity" but must also have the statistics awaiting them. In turn once the pet has been fed the stat "hunger" should decrease to a 0 showing that the pet has been fed.
