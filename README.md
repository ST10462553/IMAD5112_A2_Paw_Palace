# Welcome
## Welcome to my second repository, named Paw_Palace. This project serves different objectives from the previous project (Historia- History app).

### Objective(s):
1. In project 2 or assignment 2 the objective is to make a "Tamagotshi" app based on the popular 1990s virtual pet toy, named "Tamagotshi". This app should mimick the original toy's experience.
2. The user must be able to take care of their virtual pet by performing tasks such as:
* feeding the pet
* playing with the pet
* bathing the pet
* taking the pet to sleep.
* analysing the health status of the pet to assess their needs.

  3. My *personal objective* for the app includes ensuring that users have an intimate feel while playing the game and to achieve this objective, I have added a small welcome message at the beginning of the application to make users feel welcomed. Furthermore, each screen from the app serves to represent the name of the activity or screen symbolising the current environment of the suppossed activity between users and their beloved pet. Alongside the name of activity, I bare witty slogans meant to make the user feel the sensation of coziness while on the app.
  4. # Below examples of the activity with their slogans are displayed:
    * The Eatery -( displays on the screen when users click the Eat button) - 
    * The games room -(displays on the screen when user clicks the play button) - "Pups just wanna have fun"
    * Sleep - ( displays on the screen when user clicks on the sleep button) - "Let Sleeping dogs lie."
